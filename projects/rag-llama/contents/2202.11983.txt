However in challenging scenarios like drone videos they still suffer from problems such as small objects camera movements and view changes. In this paper we propose a new multiple object tracker which employs Global Information And some Optimizing strategies named GIAOTracker. It consists of three stages i.e. online tracking global link and postprocessing. Given detections in every frame the first stage generates reliable tracklets using information of camera motion object motion and object appearance. Then they are associated into trajectories by exploiting global clues and refined through four postprocessing methods. With the effectiveness of the three stages GIAOTracker achieves stateoftheart performance on the VisDrone MOT dataset and wins the 3rd place in the VisDrone2021 MOT Challenge.

Computer technology related to computer vision and image processing Objects detected with OpenCVs Deep Neural Network module dnn by using a YOLOv3 model trained on COCO dataset capable to detect objects of 80 common classes Object detection is a computer technology related to computer vision and image processing that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class such as humans buildings or cars in digital images and videos.  Wellresearched domains of object detection include face detection and pedestrian detection . Object detection has applications in many areas of computer vision including image retrieval and video surveillance . Uses  Detection of objects on a road It is widely used in computer vision tasks such as image annotation   vehicle counting  activity recognition   face detection  face recognition  video object cosegmentation . It is also used in tracking objects  for example tracking a ball during a football match tracking movement of a cricket bat or tracking a person in a video. Often the test images are sampled from a different data distribution making the object detection task significantly more difficult.  To address the challenges caused by the domain gap between training and test data many unsupervised domain adaptation approaches have been proposed.      A simple and straightforward solution for reducing the domain gap is to apply an imagetoimage translation approach such as cycleGAN.  Among other uses crossdomain object detection is applied in autonomous driving where models can be trained on a vast amount of video game scenes since the labels can be generated without manual labor. Concept  Every object class has its own special features that help in classifying the class  for example all circles are round.
Object class detection uses these special features. For example when looking for circles objects that are at a particular distance from a point i.e. the center are sought. Similarly when looking for squares objects that are perpendicular at corners and have equal side lengths are needed.  A similar approach is used for face identification where eyes nose and lips can be found and features like skin color and distance between eyes can be found. Benchmarks  Intersection over union as a similarity measure for object detection on images   an important task in computer vision . For object localization true positive is often measured by the thresholded intersection over union . For example if there is a traffic sign in the image with a bounding box drawn by a human ground truth label then a neural network has detected the traffic sign a true positive  at 0.5 threshold iff it has drawn a bounding box whose IoU with the ground truth is above 0.5. Otherwise the bounding box is a false positive . If there is only a single ground truth bounding box but multiple predictions then the IoU of each prediction is calculated. The prediction with the highest IoU is a true positive if it is above threshold else it is a false positive. All other predicted bounding boxes are false positives. If there is no prediction with an IoU above the threshold then the ground truth label has a false negative . For simultaneous object localization and classification a true positive is one where the class label is correct and the bounding box has an IoU exceeding the threshold. Simultaneous object localization and classification is benchmarked by the mean average precision mAP. The average precision AP of the network for a class of objects is the area under the precisionrecall curve as the IoU threshold is varied. The mAP is the average of AP over all classes. Methods  Simplified example of training a neural network in object detection The network is trained by multiple images that are known to depict starfish and sea urchins  which are correlated with nodes that represent visual features . The starfish match with a ringed texture and a star outline whereas most sea urchins match with a striped texture and oval shape. However the instance of a ring textured sea urchin creates a weakly weighted association between them. Subsequent run of the network on an input image left  The network correctly detects the starfish. However the weakly weighted association between ringed texture and sea urchin also confers a weak signal to the latter from one of two intermediate nodes. In addition a shell that was not included in the training gives a weak signal for the oval shape also resulting in a weak signal for the sea urchin output. These weak signals may result in a false positive result for sea urchin. In reality textures and outlines would not be represented by single nodes but rather by associated weight patterns of multiple nodes. Methods for object detection generally fall into either neural networkbased or nonneural approaches. For nonneural approaches it becomes necessary to first define features using one of the methods below then using a technique such as support vector machine SVM to do the classification. On the other hand neural techniques are able to do endtoend object detection without specifically defining features and are typically based on convolutional neural networks CNN.

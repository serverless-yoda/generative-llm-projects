Rodriguez View PDF Abstract A new solution of fourdimensional vacuum General Relativity is presented. It describes the near horizon region of the extreme maximally spinning binary black hole system with two identical extreme Kerr black holes held in equilibrium by a massless strut. This is the first example of a nonsupersymmetric asymptotically flat near horizon extreme binary black hole geometry of two uncharged black holes. The black holes are corotating and the solution is uniquely specified by the mass. The binary extreme system has finite entropy. The distance between the black holes is fixed but there is a zerodistance limit where the objects collapse into one. This limiting geometry corresponds to the near horizon extreme Kerr NHEK black hole.

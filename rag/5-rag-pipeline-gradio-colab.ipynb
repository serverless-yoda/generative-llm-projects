            "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) allows companies to effectively access and utilize all of their internal data, including historical data about their operations, customer interactions, and product information. It combines this data with an understanding of specific customer needs, enabling organizations to leverage their vast data resources more effectively than before. This capability is particularly beneficial for larger companies that have significant amounts of data that are not readily accessible or fully utilized. RAG represents a significant advancement in how companies can connect customers and employees with their data resources, moving beyond previous limitations.\n"

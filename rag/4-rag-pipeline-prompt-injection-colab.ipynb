Understanding RAG: Basics and Principles#\\nModern day large language models (LLM) are impressive, but they have never seen your company’s private data (hopefully!). This means the ability of an LLM to help your company fully utilize its own data is very limited. This very large barrier has given rise to the concept of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), where you are using the power and capabilities of the LLM, but combining it with the knowledge and data contained within your company’s internal data repositories. This is the primary motivation for using RAG, to make new data available to the LLM and significantly increase the value you can extract from that data. Beyond internal data, it is also useful in cases where the LLM has not been trained on the data, even if it is public, like the most recent research papers or articles about a topic that is strategic to your company.\")"

Why not use fine-tuning in all situations? Once you have introduced the new knowledge, it will always have it! It is also how the model was originally created, by training with data, right? That sounds right in theory, but in practice, fine-tuning has been more reliable in teaching a model specialized tasks (like teaching a model how to converse in a certain way), and less reliable for factual recall. The reason is complicated, but in general, a model’s knowledge of facts is like a human’s long-term memory. If you memorize a long passage from a speech or book and then try to recall it a few months later, you will likely still understand the context of the information, but you may forget specific details. Whereas, adding knowledge through the input of the model is like our short-term memory, where the facts, details, and even the order of wording is all very fresh and available for recall. It is this latter scenario that lends itself better in a situation where you want successful factual recall. There is a trade-off though. Inputs are limited by the context window of the model. This is an area that is actively being addressed though. For example, ChatGPT 3.5 only had a 4,096 token context window, which is the equivalent of about 5 pages of text. When ChatGPT 4 was released, they expanded the context window to 8,192 tokens (10 pages) and there was a Chat 4-32k version that had a context window of 32,768 tokens  (40 pages). This issue is so important that they included the context window size in the name of the model.'),\n",

But for most of the book, I felt it would keep things simple and let you focus on the core principles of RAG if we focus on the type of model that most RAG pipelines use, the LLM. But I did want to make sure it was clear, that while the book focuses primarily on LLMs, RAG can also be applied to other types of generative models, such as those for images and videos. Some popular examples of LLMs are the OpenAI ChatGPT models, the Meta LLaMA models, Google’s PaLM and Gemini models, and Anthropic’s Claude models. Foundation model\\nA foundation model is the base model for most LLMs. In the case of ChatGPT, the foundation model is based on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture, and it was fine-tuned for Chat. The specific model used for ChatGPT is not publicly disclosed. The base GPT model cannot talk with you in chatbot-style like ChatGPT does. It had to get further trained to gain that skill. But there are many other skills these foundation models can be fine-tuned for. LLaMA 2 is a foundation model and because it is open source, there are many spin offs that have been fine-tuned for many applications, such as medical research and conversation. Most of the models we talk about are very close to foundation models, but will likely be fine-tuned for at least conversational capabilities. Parameters and Biases\\nWe are trying to keep our focus on RAG primarily in this book, but it will be helpful for you to understand what parameters and biases are in LLM models. In machine learning models in general, including LLMs, parameters and biases are the learnable variables that the model adjusts during the training process to improve its performance on a given task. Parameters are the weights associated with the connections between neurons in the model\\'s architecture. These weights determine the strength and importance of each connection and are updated during training to minimize the difference between the model\\'s predictions and the expected outputs. Biases, on the other hand, are additional values added to the weighted sum of inputs at each neuron. They help the model learn an offset or shift in the data, allowing for more flexibility in fitting the training data. Together, parameters and biases form the learnable components of the model that are fine-tuned using the training data to improve the model\\'s performance on specific tasks or domains. Understanding parameters and biases is important in the context of RAG because the process of training and fine-tuning LLMs involves adjusting these variables. I mention foundation models, where the initial training involves setting these parameters and biases. However, fine-tuning an LLM by further adjusting its parameters and biases can significantly impact its performance and behavior within a RAG pipeline. By adapting the model to specific domains, writing styles, or tasks, you can improve the accuracy and relevance of the LLM\\'s responses when it is used to generate output based on the retrieved information. This, in turn, can lead to better overall performance of the RAG system in terms of providing more useful and context-appropriate answers to user queries. Therefore, choosing an LLM that is properly fine-tuned for your domain, or applying the fine-tuning yourself, is crucial for optimizing the most important element of your RAG pipeline. Prompting, Prompt Design, Prompt Engineering\\nThese terms are sometimes used interchangeably, but technically, while they all have to do with prompting, they do have fairly different meanings. Prompting is the act of sending a query or “prompt” into an LLM. Prompt design refers to the strategy you take to “design” the prompt you will send to the LLM. There are many different prompt design strategies that work in different scenarios, and we will review many of these in Chapter 13, Utilizing Prompt Engineering to Improve RAG Efforts. We will also review prompt engineering in chapter 13. Prompt engineering focuses more on the technical aspects surrounding the prompt that you use to improve the outputs from the LLM. For example, you may break up a complex query into two or three different LLM interactions, “engineering” it better to achieve superior results. Inference\\nWe will use the term ‘inference’ from time to time. Generally, this refers to the process of the LLM generating outputs or predictions based on given inputs using a pre-trained language model. But a key aspect of inference is that with an LLM, particularly with the cloud-based providers, you are charged based on the inference. Context Window\\nA context window, in the context of LLMs, refers to the maximum number of tokens (words, subwords, or characters) that the model can process as input or generate as output in a single pass. It determines the amount of text the model can \"see\" or \"attend to\" at once when making predictions or generating responses. The context window size is a key parameter of the model architecture and is typically fixed during model training. It directly relates to the input size of the model, as it sets an upper limit on the number of tokens that can be fed into the model at a time. For example, if a model has a context window size of 4,096 tokens, it means that the model can process and generate sequences of up to 4,096 tokens. When processing longer texts, such as documents or conversations, the input needs to be divided into smaller segments that fit within the context window. This is often done using techniques like sliding windows or truncation. The size of the context window has implications for the model\\'s ability to understand and maintain long-range dependencies and context. Models with larger context windows can capture and utilize more contextual information when generating responses, which can lead to more coherent and contextually relevant outputs. However, increasing the context window size also increases the computational resources required to train and run the model. In the context of RAG, the context window size is particularly important because it determines how much information from the retrieved documents can be effectively utilized by the model when generating the final response. Recent advancements in language models have led to the development of models with significantly larger context windows, enabling them to process and retain more information from the retrieved sources. Fine-Tuning in 2 Flavors: Full Model Fine Tuning (FMFT) and Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT)\\nFull model fine-tuning (FMFT) is where you take a foundation model and train it further to gain new capabilities. You could simply give it new knowledge for a specific domain, or you could give it a skill, like being a conversational chat-bot. FMFT updates all of the parameters and biases in the model. PEFT is a type of fine-tuning, where you focus only on specific parts of the parameters or biases when you fine-tune the model, but with a similar goal as general fine-tuning. The latest research in this area shows that you can achieve similar results to FMFT with far less cost, time commitment, and data. While this book is not focused on fine-tuning, it is a very valid strategy to try to use a model fine-tuned with your own data to give it more knowledge from your domain or to give it more of “voice” from your domain. For example, you could train it to talk more like a scientist than a generic foundation model, if using this in a scientific field.'),\n",

Ultimately, when deciding between RAG and fine-tuning, consider your specific use case and requirements. RAG is generally superior for retrieving factual information that is not present in the LLM's training data or is private. It allows for dynamic integration of external knowledge without modifying the model's weights.\")],\n",
